üîó **Built on Snap's [AI Assistant 
Sample](https://github.com/Snapchat/Spectacles-Sample/tree/main/AI%20Assistant)**  
*(Original features: Text-to-Speech, Camera Access, AI Vision, Fetch API)*

## Project Description
D√©cor Assistant is an augmented reality tool built for Snap Spectacles, 
enabling users to visualize and interact with interior design concepts 
within their own physical spaces. This project leverages Snap's AI 
Assistant Sample as a foundation, extending its capabilities for 
intelligent spatial design.

## Base Project Features
- Voice commands (SIK Text-to-Speech)
- Real-time camera feed processing
- HTTP requests via Fetch API

## Key Features
**Surface-Aware AR Placement**: Precisely anchors virtual d√©cor objects to 
detected walls and floors using WorldQueryHit (integrated from Snap's AI 
Assistant Sample).

**AI-Powered Style Analysis**: Employs custom integration with GPT-4o to 
analyze scanned room environments and suggest relevant interior design 
styles.

**DALLE Visualization**: Generates photorealistic image previews of 
redesigned spaces based on AI style recommendations and user 
customizations.

**Dual Interaction Modes**:
- Toggle between AI suggestions & manual drag-and-drop
  - **AI Suggestions Mode**: Receives automated d√©cor style 
recommendations and visualizations driven by AI.
  - **Manual Design Mode**: Allows for direct and intuitive placement of 
virtual objects using SpawnOnSurface for personalized design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
| Component | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| AR Foundation | Snap Spectacles Experimental API |
| Surface Detection | Custom WorldQueryHit extensions |
| AI Integration | OpenAI GPT-4o + DALLE-3 |
| 3D Models | CREDITS.md |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
**Base Project**: Modified version of Snap's AI Assistant Sample 
(developed with Lens Studio v5.7.2.25).

**Key Extensions**:
- **Custom OpenAI Integration**: Seamlessly integrates GPT-4o for 
intelligent style analysis and DALLE for realistic image generation.
- **Enhanced Object Library**: Includes a curated selection of 
high-quality 3D models sourced from Sketchfab (see Licenses & 
Attributions).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
### Prerequisites
- Snap Spectacles (2021 or later)
- Lens Studio (v5.7.2.25 or later)
- OpenAI API key with access to both GPT-4o and DALLE models.

### Run the Project
